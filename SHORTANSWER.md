# 1- What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make it the right next step in your career?
Improve networking. Increase technical (programming) skills. Learn new (automation test) frameworks, especially automation
strategies, considering the concept of the automation test wheel: https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/an-introduction-to-the-automation-test-wheel (that is, if possible, understand and work with the best tools/methods available for each segment of the test wheel).

# 2- What have you learned so far about LawnStarter that excited you?
My understanding is that LawnStarter is a technology company that seeks to simplify mowing. A potential customer accesses our website, enters their information, and then obtains an instant online quote, including the date they want the service to start. 

On the contractors' side, they should receive some alert/email informing them that they must have a job available. There must be an interface for contractors to 'claim' the job, displaying the name, address, date it needs to be done and how much the job pays.

This could be very stimulating for customers and companies. I gave up about 3 or 4 times to let the grass grow in the garden because it was complicated to prune it - I can only imagine how owners of larger areas can benefit from this service. I believe that, with appropriate policies and the right system in place, this could be the future of lawn care and related services.

# 3- Have you worked in a setting where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable in an environment which challenges quality engineers to constantly look for opportunities to automate and ensure quality software is delivered on a daily basis?
Yes, I have worked in QA leadership positions in similar settings where the focus was to look for opportunities to automate API (REST) and UI tests, using many different development frameworks, such as pure Scrum, Scrum with BDD, ATDD, XP with TDD etc.. 
I still think QA goes beyond that (performance tests, unit/integration tests, accessibility tests, and visual tests) and I look forward to the being able to work closely with a development team that understands the value of automated QA, also by deploying features that make QA automation possible/easier.

# 4- What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?
I am hoping to learn Cypress.io (when I get the chance) and Applitools (for extended UI automation)
