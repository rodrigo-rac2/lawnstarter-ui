# 1- What parts of this did you enjoy?
It was a great challenge overall. I never automated against the google address modal and some structures in your page and had to resort to some keystroke techniques but I felt the tests are reliable.
I am not sure I did the JSON to CSV fully according to the requirements, because I decided to code a REST api, but I thought that it would be more useful to possibly make a postman/insomnia request with a JSON string and get the response accordingly. This API obviously needs to be improved.

# 2- What parts of this did you dislike?
Some pages of the application have hidden inputs without name tags and/or ids. In my opinion, such pages are not QA automation-redy (however, on the other hand, they are better protected against bots - intented or a side-effect? if intended, why wasn't this a pattern across the entire app?). For those pages, I accessed the DOM directly, which worked fine but this is not ideal.
Actually even those situations were not really 'dislikes', just different challenges. I really enjoyed the whole experience.

# 3- Any other comments/feedback?
I think your team has a great business model and a very good product in hands. I hope I can be a part of your team.
